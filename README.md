# Email/SMS Spam Classifier

This project implements a simple Email/SMS Spam Classifier using Streamlit.

## Introduction

This application aims to classify incoming messages (emails or SMS) as either spam or not spam. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of labeled messages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Once the application is running, enter your message in the provided text area and click on the "Predict" button to classify the message as spam or not spam.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application.
- `model.pkl`: Trained machine learning model.
- `vectorizer.pkl`: TF-IDF vectorizer.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `screenshots/`: Folder containing screenshots or GIFs of the application.

## Code Explanation

The `app.py` file loads the trained model and vectorizer, preprocesses the input message, and makes predictions using a simple TF-IDF based approach.

## Screenshots/GIFs

Include screenshots or GIFs here to demonstrate your application in action. You can capture different states of your application, such as when a message is classified as spam and when it's not.
